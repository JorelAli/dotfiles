# Dotfiles

Everyone says that a Linux user's dotfiles are basically everything. I too agree.
If you want to find out about my dotfiles, I highly recommend reading the [`.gitignore`](https://github.com/JorelAli/dotfiles/blob/master/.gitignore) file, as it contains comments for each folder and file included in this repository
